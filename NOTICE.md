These basebox templates were adopted wholesale from [Chef's Bento Project](https://github.com/chef/bento), which is a great way to learn the value of [Packer](https://packer.io/)

The Preseed and [Kickstart](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart) templates and the Bash Packer provisioner scripts were also adopted wholesale from Bento.
